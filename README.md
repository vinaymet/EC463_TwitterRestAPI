This is a Twitter Rest API Project for BU EC463 - Senior Design

In this mini software project, we have developed a web app where the users enters a twitter user who he wants to track and then, is able to analyze different aspects retrieved from the twits of the selected user such as the sentiment, main content or how likely they are to be bots. 

GOOGLE NATURAL LANGUAGE API:

We have implemented the Google Natural Language API, which includes different features such as sentiment analysis, entity analysis or content classification. We have used it to analyze the text on the twits that were retrieved. 

BOT CHECKER:

A social bot is an automatic program that simulates human behavior on social network, taking part in discussions or spreading unverified information around social media. Malicious bots usually follow the same patterns, that’s why we have used “Botometer”, a supervised machine learning tool for bot detection on twitter which we have accessed using an API.
